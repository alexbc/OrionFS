Componants
- Dbs.py, the dumb block server.
- Resilverd.py, The resilvering daemon

DBS is a very dumb block server, it quickly retrieves/stores blocks from disk to the network.

ResilverD resilvers blocks between DBS's so that it meets the criteria specified (ie. that at least N copies exist, etc.)

ClientD is the clientside daemon that connects to backend servers and retrieves data for them

simplefuse is a very simple and slow implementation of the client side of orionfs

Client.py is the actual fuse client side library
